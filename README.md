Hi!

In the first step you must run fetch_data.py to collect data from binance and yahoo finance for mongodb. You may need vpn in this step, because we are under
binance sanction.
At step two, run api.py that create a server for grahpql queries.
At last, run main.py to see the outputs. You can change some parameters in main.py for changing currency pairs and plot option.

Note:This project, created by pycharm and object oriented form. That means some .py files are imported to others.
Note:Close the plots when you saw it to program can continue to run.

Good luck!
